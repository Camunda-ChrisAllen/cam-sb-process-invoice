# Process Invoice

## Camunda Spring Boot Application

This is a simple example that includes the following:

1. A process called "Process Invoice".  Once started, it wait for three message events to arrive before finishing.
2. A custom web service that accepts an invoice.  Once it receives this invoice, it will get embedded into a Camunda web service request to kick off the Process Invoice process, then it will call Camunda.
3. A postman collection to initiate:
   1. The first web service call with the invoice.
   2. The Camunda web service calls to simulate the correlation of the messages.

When testing the message correlation, note that the message correlation payload JSON needs a unique business key for the process instance.  Please retrieve that from Cockpit.
